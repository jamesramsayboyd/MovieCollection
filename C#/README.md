# C# .NET Framework Forms app

![Screenshot of C# .NET Framework app](/C#/assets/images/screenshot.png)

This is my initial prototype for the app, created as a C# .NET Framework Forms app because that's what I'm most familiar with.
- Stores movies as objects of a custom Movie class, adds them to a List<T> and displays them using a ListView
- User can add new movies, delete and edit existing ones, sort the list alphabetically by title
- Just a quick prototype to act as a template to an Android app as my first Kotlin project
