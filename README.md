# MovieCollection

![Screenshot of main, detailed and add activities](/Kotlin-prototype/assets/images/moviecollectionapp.png)

My first attempt at developing a simple Android app

This will be a simple object-oriented program to keep track of my own collection of movies on DVD. I will be using a Class to store Movie Objects with properties for Title, Release Year, Director, etc. I plan to create the app as a C# .NET Framework Forms app first (as that is what I'm most familiar with), then try and translate that to Kotlin as my first project in that language. 

As advanced functionality I also plan to learn how to use the IComparable interface to create several different methods of sorting the list of Movie Objects, for example by title, year released, director last name, etc.
